# React JS workshop

Example app created by [Mauricio Dinarte](https://www.drupal.org/u/dinarcon) ([@dinarcon](https://twitter.com/dinarcon)) to explain React JS concepts.

You need to serve the files from a web server. Any language's built-in server will work. For example, to run using PHP open the terminal, change directory into the app's code, and run:

```
php -S localhost:9000
```

The open your browser at http://localhost:9000/

Using React Dev Tools for your browser is highly recommended.
