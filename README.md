# React JS workshop

Example app created by [Mauricio Dinarte](https://www.drupal.org/u/dinarcon) ([@dinarcon](https://twitter.com/dinarcon)) to explain React JS concepts.

You need to serve the files from a web server. Any language's built-in server will work. Open the terminal, change directory into the app's code, and run the web server. Below are some alternatives for different languages:

```
php -S localhost:5500
```

Then open your browser at http://localhost:5500/

Using the React Dev Tools extension for your browser is highly recommended.
